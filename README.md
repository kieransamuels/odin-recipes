# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
In this project I will be using putting my knowledge of HTML to the test!
I'll be building a basic recipe website that will have links to a few recipes on the main index page! 
The skills that I will demonstrate is the use of Lists, Elements and Tags, and Links and Images!
