    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are as many ways to make jerk chicken in Jamaica as there are chefs, but they all use the same technique:
        Spices and chillies dominate the seasoning mixture used to coat and cook the chicken. Everything you expect jerk
        chicken to be, including spicy, smoky, and fragrant, is in this version. But what distinguishes this one from
        the others? The marinade's major ingredient is Chinese five-spice. For optimal reslits, marinate the chicken for
        at least an entire night to give the flavour enough time to penetrate the meat completely. If preferred, the
        chicken can also be oven-roasted.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 Scotch bonnet chillies, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon allspice berries, coarsely ground</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Two 3 1/2- to 4-pound chickens, quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper,
            thyme, nutmeg and salt; process to a coarse paste. With the machine on, add the the soy sauce and oil in a
            steady stream. Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and
            refrigerate overnight. Bring the chicken to room temperature before proceeding.</li>
        <li>Light a grill. Grill the chicken over a medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked
            through, 35 to 40 minutes. (Cover the grill for a smokier flavor.) Transfer the chicken to a platter and
            serve.</li>
    </ol>
