    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular breakfast options, pancakes are great for holiday brunches and weekend mornings spent
        with the whole family. These pancakes benefit from the tanginess and tenderness of buttermilk, and the baking
        soda and buttermilk acid combine to help the pancakes rise and become wonderfully fluffy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or neutral oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, buttermilk, and butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture into flour, stirring to combine. Gently stir egg mixture into flour, mixing just enough to
            moisten flour; don't worry about having a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Allow the batter to rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Heat butter or oil in skillet. When butter foam
            subsides or oil shimmers, ladle 1/3 cup batter into skillet. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and
            pancakes are brown, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip pancakes and cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold in a 250Â°F oven until ready to
            serve.</li>
    </ol>
